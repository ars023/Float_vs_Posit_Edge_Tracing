# Float_vs_Posit_Edge_Tracing
# These files contain on how to run a simple edge tracing algorithm using both posits and floating points, referred to as floats. 
# Availiable in both 16 and 32 bits, each file also giving a graphic representation of the rays being shot at the traingle as well as indicators to show whether a hit on the inside is marked or not.
# The goal of this project was to show the effectiveness and consistency of posits over floating points thus resulting in fewer light leaks in practice hence motivating a change in the current IEEE standard.
